
This project mimics a simple smart home setup using MQTT as a mode of communication. The idea is to enable/register the devices in different rooms and then provide a control mechanism for the user to perform different operations on those devices.

Skills and Tools

Paho mqtt: How to use mqtt client in real-time scenario.
Design: One of the key aspect of this project is the need to create an efficient topic structure to handle the messages as MQTT is a pub-sub model. Use python to perform data handling on the received messages. From a design perspective, the project shows the need of a server as an interface to pass on the communication from user to the device.
