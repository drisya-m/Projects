This project mimics a simple distributed data store that uses a consistent hashing scheme to map key-value data to specific database nodes. It uses the technique of virtual nodes to implement consistent hashing in a master less data fetch setup. The project involves computing a per-node virtual node mapping, inserting and fetching key-value data, and addition & removal of nodes.

Skills and Tools

Understanding of how a masterless distributed Database would work, with respect to: Data insertion Data fetch Dynamic batch-updates of Python data structures, mainly dictionaries, random module utilities and math module utilities.
